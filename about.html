      <h3>My Story</h3>
      <p class="projects-par">I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and human experience. My
        journey began in 2006 when I got my first MacBook alongside a Pentium IV PC—sparking a passion that would shape
        my career and life pursuits. While many know me as a designer who prototypes interfaces for AI systems, I'm also
        an explorer constantly seeking what lies beyond the horizon, turning imagination into reality.
        My professional path in extended reality took off with an Oculus GO, which became the foundation for my project
        Synesthesia VR. This blend of technical expertise and creative vision defines my approach to design and
        development.

      <h3>Beyond the Screen</h3>
      <p class="projects-par">
        When I'm not designing digital experiences, you'll find me embracing physical challenges:
        Completed the Grand Canyon Rim to Rim hike with my dad in just 8 hours and 59 minutes
        Conquered numerous mountain trails around Vancouver, BC
        Learned to ski in the legendary slopes of Chamonix Mont-Blanc, France (Oui, je parle français comme un
        étudiant!)
        Cycled, ran, swam, and played tennis across beautiful landscapes
        I maintain strong connections with my roots, flying to Chicago quarterly to visit family. One of my proudest
        adventures was road-tripping across Canada from Toronto to Vancouver in just 5 days with friends—a journey that
        epitomizes my approach to both life and work: ambitious, efficient, and always enjoyable.
      </p>

      <h3>What's Next</h3>
      <p class="projects-par">I'm currently producing a mixed reality film that pushes technical boundaries by combining
        3D animation, Gaussian splatting, and WebXR technologies. This project represents my belief that seemingly
        disparate technologies can work together to create something extraordinary.
        My goal is to continue bridging the gap between cutting-edge technology and meaningful human experiences,
        creating immersive worlds that feel both innovative and intuitive.
      </p>

      <h3>Let's Connect</h3>
      <p class="projects-par">Have a project in mind or just want to chat about the future of XR? I'm always open to new connections and collaborations.

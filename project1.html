      <h2>About the project</h2>
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        Simon Fraser University's Design Facility embraces students' efforts in design and discovery of novel
        interactions.
        Synesthesia VR is a prototype exploring the possibility of gaze interaction with virtual environment through
        colour and sound.
        Users are guided with colourful furniture installations followed by sounds as an audio feedback fuelling the
        user's interest in the space even more.

        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p class="project-paragraph">Design and develop a Virtual Reality experience embodying user into the vision of a
          synesthete and their perception of Synesthesia. Wassily Kandinsky was chosen as a reference, since his
          research findings and documentation on synesthesia propelled the VR experience design decisions.
          Research of different syntesthetes and their perception of colour to sound. The project needed clear
          guidelines of shapes, colours, and forms to be used in the experience. Additionally, deep research on sound
          libraries was required to bridge each colour & shape to sounds and tones of various instruments. For example:
          yellow colours would playback a range of trumpet notes.
          Communicating the feeling of Synesthesia to the user inside Virtual Reality as a visual feedback was crucial
          to ensure the user comprehends seeing and hearing colours.

        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
        <p class="project-paragraph"> Guideline on colour to sound relationship created, closely followed by the team
          while developing the experience. Wassiliy Kandinsky was chosen as a role model of a Synesthete. His research and books on Synesthesia
          tremendously helped the team in identifying colour palette of the experience as well as the visual style of
          the virtual world. Color filters were introduced as a visual playback on successful identification of shape and colour. The user
          would gaze at an object to see a virtual coloured overlay on their eyes approving the seen object.

      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p class="project-paragraph"> Researching and gathering requirements to create a sense of synesthesia inside
        Virtual Reality. Design and prototyping of User Interactions, visual feedback, and virtual environment to embody
        the user into the mind of Wassily Kandinsky.
        In this project, I lead a team of developers, 3D designers, and sound engineers to establish guidelines and
        rules to applying sound to colours connection.

        <h3>Prototyping Interactions</h3>
        <p class="project-paragraph">User's interaction inside Virtual Reality was a significant key to a successful
          embodiment into a synesthete. The team experimented hard in search for an ideal human to computer input in VR
          such that the user discovers the ability to see like a synesthete.

          interactions and emotions from the experience are captured. Some of the users were later interviewed on their
          understanding of synesthesia and feelings they had while being a synesthete for couple of minutes in Virtual
          Reality. </p>

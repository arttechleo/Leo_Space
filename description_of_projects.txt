                about: "Ever wished academic papers were less… paper-y? Scholarly VR lets professors and students step inside research itself, turning dense concepts into immersive 3D experiences. Because if knowledge is power, why not make it feel like a superpower?"

This interactive installation features a massive wall projection, an 88-key piano as a controller, and an AI that’s out to prove humans are overrated at playing with colors. Are you up for the challenge? (Spoiler: the AI thinks you’re not.)"

Inspired by John Cage’s 4'33'', this VR experience lets you explore soundscapes from everyday life—your apartment, your city, maybe even the weird noise your fridge makes at night. It’s a concert, but the world is the composer."

      <h2>About the project</h2>
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        Talegraph explores the intersection of 3D design for completing regular job tasks but virtually in a 3D space. For example, in the demo a prototype of operating 
        a coffee machine is shown to represent a future way of completing work. Adopting this idea to the modern times, Talegraph was looking into the future of letting
        users to teleoperate robotic arms and humanoids using 3D environment and interactions. Another prototype, this time in Virtual Reality was built a year after to
        test the notion of being fully immersed into virtual reality.

        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p class="project-paragraph"> Design a virtual environment and human to computer interactions such that the idea is comprehensive. Explaining what metaverse is 
          back in 2018 in 3D or Virtual Reality was challenging. It is not a game, not an experience. It is a place where people can do remote work or work virtually.
          The city and the hub needed to look far out from this planet to spark interest in the software. Interactions too, had to be designed for a mouse and WASD controls. 
          Plus, the idea was fundraising on Indiegogo platform.

        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
        <p class="project-paragraph"> 
          Project demo was assembled and recorded in Unity Game Engine. Indiegogo launch was unsuccesfful, however, opened doors to many other opportuinities. One of them, led to building 
          my first Virtual Reality experience. From there and to date, I became a Virtual Reality and Mixed Reality designer and developer. Talegraph was an introduction for me 
          into the world of 3D graphics, 3D modeling and 3D development. My Co-Founder, Vladislav Ryzhov was a developer exploring this project alongside me. I lead the visual look and feel of the project, 
          designed 3D futuristic architecture and learned about interaction design.

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p class="project-paragraph"> Making this project a reality was a stretch for a small but mighty team of 2. I shared my ideas of props, environmments and interactive elements with the 
      developer. Together, we identified opportuinities for design and development improvements. I sketched my ideas and later visualized them in 3D with 3Ds Max. Meshes did not use any complex textures but 
      had a lot of uncompressed and unoptimized geometry. Later in the future, I realized how many things could have been optimized for in-engine use. However, my passion to see the project and to "work" in a virtual 
      environment set the priority to finish the project as soon as possible.

  <h3>Achievements</h3>
  <p class="project-paragraph"> Designing a dream project is a journey full of exploration of oneself. As mentioned above, I gained a valuable experience in 
    the craft of 3D Game Design, gave crowdfunding a try, and tested my passion for emerging digital media. Talegraph was a dreamy idea inspiring me to pursue my jounrey in 
    mixed and virtual reality design and development. To read about my first virtual reality project follow here: <a href="project1.html">Synesthesia VR</a>.

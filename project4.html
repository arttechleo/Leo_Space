      <h2>About the project</h2>
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        Blown Away VR is an innovative virtual reality experience that introduces a unique gameplay mechanic—blowing air—to navigate through various environments. Designed as an exploration of VR’s potential, the game immerses players in a journey of determination and resilience, symbolized through the metaphor of breath.
        The story follows a dreamer striving to achieve their aspirations from childhood to adulthood, facing challenges along the way.
        Players must dodge obstacles that hinder their progress, using their breath to propel themselves forward. 
        This prototype was developed for the Oculus Quest 1 and Oculus Quest 2, showcasing the creative possibilities of alternative interaction methods in VR.

      <h3>Challenge</h3>
      <p class="project-paragraph"> The project aimed to explore unconventional VR mechanics available on the Meta platform.
        Blowing air into the microphone emerged as an engaging and intuitive form of interaction. 
        To gamify this mechanic, we built a compelling narrative around the idea of breath as a driving force.
        To communicate this concept effectively, we designed the opening sequence in a frosty winter landscape. 
        Players instinctively blow into their hands to warm them up, reinforcing the natural association between breath and warmth. 
        As the journey progresses, players board a delicate paper boat and use their breath to navigate through an icy sea filled with looming icebergs.
        From the frozen landscape, the setting transitions to a tropical paradise with palm trees swaying in the warm breeze. 
        Next, players encounter a space rocket that requires a final breath to ignite, launching them into outer space. 
        Here, they steer through the cosmos, dodging space debris while carrying their paper boat—symbolizing their connection to Earth and humanity. 
        In the game’s emotional conclusion, players release the paper boat into the vastness of space, bidding it a final farewell.

      <h3>Deliverables</h3>
      <p class="project-paragraph"> 
        Immersive environments: Designed visually distinct locations, including icy landscapes, tropical islands, and outer space.
        3D Assets: Rapid prototyping of the paper boat and space objects for integration into the game.
        Optimized VR experience: Leveraged pre-built libraries for environments to meet the 48-hour time constraint.

  <h3>Process</h3>
  <p class="project-paragraph">Working within the constraints of the Meta platform, I collaborated with developers to optimize 3D scenes and ensure smooth performance. 
    As we refined the core mechanic, we explored different methods of enhancing interaction, reinforcing the connection between breath and movement.
    I focused on crafting a cohesive visual and experiential narrative, assembling assets, and making last-minute adjustments to ensure the game was polished for submission. 
    The project was successfully completed within the 48-hour timeframe and presented during the Global Game Jam 2021.

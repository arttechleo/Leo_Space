      <h2>About the project</h2>
      <p class="project-paragraph">Structural Color Gallery debuted its early opening in 2024 to a wonderful exhibition
        of Megumi Nagai Night Trees. The audience met the new event with love and gratitude.
        The space was redesigned to highlight works of the artist. Old trees from around Brooklyn were collected and
        placed as a decoration set for this exhibit. The doors were open to the public from January 2024 to June 2024.
        While the exhbition was running, my collegue who at the time lived in New York, had an opportunity to archive
        the exhbition space with a 3D scanner and mobile based 3D capturing software.
        The goal of the project was to preserve the exhibition space using 3D scanning techniques and create an online
        space for visiting the digital replica of the event.

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <img src="./images/scg/matterport.png" alt="Artec Leo Scanner" class="image-page1">
        <p class="project-paragraph">Capturing of the exhibition space was done with a Matterport 3D scanner. The
          processed data outputs: 360 footage, lidar data (.e57), and photogrammetry.
          Additionaly, mobile scanning was used for some of the smaller elements in the space. Processing the data the
          team found out incostistencies in the model representations. Using Blender to close holes and clean up the
          data
          yielded better results. Later optimizing the scans and decimating the meshes, the team was able to produce
          web-ready models for display.

        <h3>Spatial Web Experience</h3>
        <img src="./images/scg/three.png" alt="Artec Leo Scanner" class="image-page1">
        <p class="project-paragraph"> Building a spatial web experience required experimenting with three.js camera navigation. There were different options for User Input: scroll-based camera dolly-in/dolly-out, third-person movement, point&click navigation. 
          Testing different navigation approaches the team decided to pursue third-person character navigation style since it was more accessible to the user. Below in the carousel there are recorded research outcomes with the camera movement the team tested.

    </div>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Another research for this project was optimization of the experience. Starting with mesh decimation, 
      user input redesign, and raycasting optimization the team dived deep into making the project more accessible to other users. Most of the optimization issues 
      were in 3D models. The scans had a lot of polygons and stuttered the experience on load. Loading times were tragic without optimization. To tackle this, I researched best 
      optimzation techniques for Web and published an article on medium.

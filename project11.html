      <h2>About the project</h2>
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        Piano Bar was an interactive 3D digital installation designed to explore human-machine relationships through
        musical interaction.
        The experience placed users in a structured feedback loop where their musical inputs were met with dynamic,
        shifting responses from an autonomous system.
        The installation was part of A Fun Palace: A Mixed Reality Event Through the Looking Glass of Cybernetics and
        was later published in Cybernetics & Human Knowing: A Journal of Second-Order Cybernetics, Autopoiesis, and
        Cybersemiotics.

        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          The project questioned traditional notions of agency in digital interactions. Users initially felt in control,
          playing notes on an 88-key piano and receiving mirrored responses from the system. However, as the interaction
          evolved, the machine began dictating the sequence, expecting users to comply. This shift in agency was
          designed to provoke reflection on obedience, autonomy, and the hidden power dynamics embedded in human-machine
          interfaces.

        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          The installation featured an 88-key piano as the central input device, which was connected to a responsive
          digital system. Users engaged in a structured two-phase interaction:
          Phase 1: The user played a note, and the system echoed it with a different instrument. This built an illusion
          of control.
          Phase 2: The system took the lead, playing a sequence of notes and expecting the user to replicate them
          precisely. If the user failed, the system terminated the interaction.
          This structured feedback loop created an evolving relationship between the participant and the machine,
          challenging expectations about digital agency.

      <h3>Inspiration</h3>
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        The project was inspired by second-order cybernetics, focusing on feedback loops and adaptive systems. It also
        drew on themes from synesthesia, using sound and interaction to create an altered perception of control. The
        shifting roles of user and machine reflected larger societal questions about automation, labor, and
        technological obedience.

      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        The experience was carefully designed to create a psychological shift from control to submission. The 88-key
        piano was chosen as a familiar, expressive instrument, making the transition from free play to dictated
        obedience more impactful. The system was programmed to respond dynamically, reinforcing user agency in Phase 1
        before systematically stripping it away in Phase 2. The installation was structured to be immersive yet
        unsettling, highlighting the fine line between participation and manipulation.

      <h3>Achievements</h3>
      <img src="./images/nanome/" alt="" class="image-page1">
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        Piano Bar was showcased as part of A Fun Palace and was later published in Cybernetics & Human Knowing. The
        project resonated with participants, many of whom reflected on the unsettling nature of losing agency to an
        algorithmic system. The installation sparked discussions on control, compliance, and the invisible structures
        that shape our interactions with technology. By blending musical improvisation with programmed constraints,
        Piano Bar created a thought-provoking exploration of human-machine relationships. <a href="https://www.chkjournal.com/node/357">Publication</a>

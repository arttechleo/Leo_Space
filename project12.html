      <h2>About the project</h2>
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        The Memory Game XR was a mixed reality prototype designed to explore how interactive digital experiences could
        support memory retention among older adults in caregiving facilities. Developed using WebXR, mr.js, and Blender,
        the prototype was part of research investigating how MR experiences could assist caregivers and patients in
        addressing memory loss. The game was designed to be both cognitively stimulating and engaging, offering users a
        nostalgic and educational journey through iconic artworks.

        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          Memory loss presents significant challenges for older adults, particularly those in caregiving facilities
          where cognitive stimulation is essential for well-being. The goal of Memory Game XR was to create an
          accessible, engaging, and intuitive mixed reality experience that could be played comfortably in stationary XR
          setups, including while lying down. A key design challenge was ensuring that hand interactions felt natural
          and responsive, with clear visual feedback for selected objects. The game also needed to balance cognitive
          engagement with ease of interaction, making it suitable for users with varying levels of mobility.

      <h3>Inspiration</h3>
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        The project was inspired by childhood nostalgia and art appreciation, incorporating iconic paintings as a way to
        trigger long-term memory recall. It also took inspiration from existing cognitive therapy techniques, adapting
        them into a mixed reality format that allowed users to interact with visual content in an immersive way. The
        research was conducted with a potential user persona in mind, such as Susana Baker (72 y.o.), who enjoys
        reminiscing about past experiences but struggles with short-term memory.

      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        The prototype was built using WebXR and mr.js, ensuring cross-platform compatibility while optimizing for
        hand-tracking and spatial interaction. Early testing focused on:
        hand interactions and raycasting mechanics to ensure precise object selection,
        card-matching logic and feedback loops for a smooth and rewarding gameplay experience,
        user spatial positioning considerations to enhance comfort for stationary players.
        User research was conducted through keynote presentations and feedback sessions, refining the mechanics based on
        usability insights.

      <h3>Achievements</h3>
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        The Memory Game XR prototype demonstrated the potential of mixed reality in cognitive therapy, particularly for
        older adults in caregiving facilities. Early testing suggested that the art-driven memory exercise helped evoke
        emotional connections, encouraging participants to share personal stories and engage in meaningful discussions.
        The research highlighted the importance of intuitive interaction design in XR for accessibility, providing
        valuable insights for future applications in healthcare and memory rehabilitation.
